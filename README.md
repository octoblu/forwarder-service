#Forwarder Subscription Service

This micro-service registers forwarder devices and can setup device message subscriptions on
behalf of the device owner.

## What are Forwarders?
Forwarders are devices that receive messages intended for other devices and forward the messages received
somewhere else - like a datastore or another messaging platform. They allow you to spy on messages sent, received or broadcast to or from your devices to another endpoint.
